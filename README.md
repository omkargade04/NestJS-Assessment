## Description

This application is a BACKEND PROJECT which provides users with a RESTful BookAPI able to perform CRUD Operations and stores data using PostgreSQL Database with features such as user Authentication and Authorization.

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

```

## Features of the Application
- This is a BookAPI which gives the user the specified book details.
- It allows CRUD Operations and the user can Add, Update, Get and Delete the Book details accordingly
- It is a RESTful API
- If you access the header with wrong username and password field you will get an error.
- The beauty of Nestjs is its unique Architecture which provides inbuilt Dtos, Controllers, Providers and Modules
- PostgreSQL is used to store the Book Details and the User Details.
- The User needs to be Authenticated to use the application. We dont have UI for Authentication but we do have an endpoint for it which we can integrate in future.
- The is also an endpoint for Role Authorization
- 
## Flow of Application
- First step is you need to integrate your database(PostgreSQL) with the application 
  go to .local.env and add your database credentials accordingly
- Run the following command line : "npm run start:dev" to get started with the application
- To test the API endpoints, open any API Tester application such as Postman or Thunder Client.
- Make sure that the Header Field has the same username and password as given in the "book.guard.ts". username = "user", password = "password".
- Test the APIs and you are all set to go.
